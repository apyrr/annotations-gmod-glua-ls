---Gets the REAL weapon table, not a copy. The produced table does *not* inherit fields from the weapon's base class, unlike [weapons.Get](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/weapons.Get).

--- **WARNING**: Modifying this table will modify what is stored by the weapons library. Take a copy or use [weapons.Get](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/weapons.Get) to avoid this.
