---Creates an entity. This function will fail and return `NULL` if the networked-edict limit is hit (around **8176**), or the provided entity class doesn't exist.
--- **WARNING**: Do not use before GM:InitPostEntity has been called, otherwise the server will crash!
--- If you need to perform entity creation when the game starts, create a hook for GM:InitPostEntity and do it there.
